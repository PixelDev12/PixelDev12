### About Me
👋 Hi there! I'm PixelDev on Discord, PixelDev12 on GitHub, and Guy234C on Roblox.

I'm a passionate and dedicated developer with a deep love for scripting and problem-solving. My journey in development started over 2–3 years ago, and since then, I've focused primarily on Lua, particularly within Roblox Studio. I enjoy creating systems that are not only functional but also engaging and user-friendly.

Beyond scripting, I’m always eager to learn new technologies, refine my skills, and collaborate with others to bring creative ideas to life. Let’s create something amazing together! 🚀

### Work Experience
💻 Coding in Lua: My expertise lies in scripting for Roblox, where I’ve built numerous systems for games, focusing on performance, scalability, and player experience.
🐍 Coding in Python: I also have experience with Python for automation, data manipulation, and general programming tasks.

I thrive in designing interactive, efficient, and enjoyable systems that bring games to life.

### Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've developed using Lua (Roblox Studio):

⚔️ Combat System: A dynamic combat system with responsive controls and animations.
🚤 Boat Steering System: A realistic and smooth boat handling mechanic for water-based gameplay.
💬 Dialogue System: An interactive dialogue system to enhance storytelling and NPC interactions.
❤️ Health Management System: A robust health system with regeneration, damage handling, and UI integration.
🤝 Object Interaction System: A system enabling players to interact seamlessly with objects in the game world.

Each of these projects demonstrates my ability to combine creativity with technical skills, resulting in polished, high-quality work.
